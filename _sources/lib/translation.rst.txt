lib.translation
---------------

This library implements the translation support for the core and the plugins.

.. note::

   Translations for the Administration Interface (Javascript) are not done through this API!

   The translations for the webinterfaces are handled by this library, because the translations are done in Python
   and not on the html/Javascript side of the code.


The API is implemented through the following library:


.. automodule:: lib.translation
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
    :member-order: bysource

============================
Release 1.1 - 13. April 2016
============================

After the last release of SmartHome.py many changes piled up in develop but were never committed into the release.
Thus many users switched from the master branch to the develop branch. Even people with not so much knowledge
chose this route.

Finally the original creator of SmartHome.py chose not to continue the development on this software but to create a new
software. So the decision was made to fork SmartHome.py into SmartHomeNG.

The first action was to consilidate a couple of changes in develop into a new master branch. So this branch here
incorporates many changes since 2013 and is the first release.

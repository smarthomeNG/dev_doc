Überblick
=========

Dieses ist neues Release für SmartHomeNG. Die Änderungen gegenüber dem Release v1.8.x sind im
folgenden in diesen Release Notes beschrieben.


Unterstützte Python Versionen
-----------------------------

Die älteste offiziell unterstützte Python Version für SmartHomeNG Release 1.9 ist Python 3.7.
(Siehe auch *Hard- u. Software Anforderungen* im Abschnitt *Installation* zu unterstützten Python Versionen)

Das bedeutet nicht unbedingt, dass SmartHomeNG ab Release 1.9 nicht mehr unter älteren Python Versionen läuft,
sondern das SmartHomeNG nicht mehr mit älteren Python Versionen getestet wird und das gemeldete Fehler mit älteren
Python Versionen nicht mehr zu Buxfixen führen.


Minimum Python Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Die absolute Minimum Python Version in der SmartHomeNG startet wurde auf v3.6 angehoben, da Python 3.5 im
September 2020 End-of-Life (End of security fixes) gegangen ist. Bei einer Neuinstallation wird jedoch empfohlen
auf einer der neueren Python Versionen (3.7 oder 3.8) aufzusetzen.

Outdated Plugins
----------------

The following plugins were already marked in version v1.6 as *deprecated*. This means that the plugins
are still working, but are not developed further anymore and are removed from the release of SmartHomeNG
in the next release. User of these plugins should switch to corresponding succeeding plugins.

* System Plugins

  * backend - use the administration interface instead
  * sqlite_visu2_8 - switch to the **database** plugin

* Web Plugins

  * wunderground - the free API is not provided anymore by Wunderground


The following plugins are marked as *deprecated* with SmartHomeNG v1.7, because neither user nor tester have been found:

* Gateway Plugins

  * tellstick

* Interface Plugins

  * easymeter
  * smawb
  * vr100

Moreover, the previous mqtt plugin was renamed to mqtt1 and marked as *deprecated*, because the new mqtt
